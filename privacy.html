      Policy applies to
      <a href="http:lawvee.com">lawvee.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
      "lawvee.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
      personally identifiable information you may provide us through the
      Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain
      what information may be collected on our Mobile App or Website, how we use
      this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the

      This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
      Mobile App or Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing

      visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and
      conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>App or Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most app and website operators, Lawvee Prep collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
      Lawvee Prep's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
      is to better understand how Lawvee Prep's visitors use its website and
      app. From time to time, Lawvee Prep may release non-personally-identifying
      information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
      the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawvee Prep also collects potentially personally-identifying information
      like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
      leaving comments on http://lawvee.com blog posts or Mobile App forum.
      Lawvee Prep only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under
      the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Lawvee Prep's websites choose to interact with Lawvee
      Prep in ways that require Lawvee Prep to gather personally-identifying
      information. The amount and type of information that Lawvee Prep gathers
      depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
      sign up for an exam test at http://lawvee.com to provide a username and
      email address.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
